Big Problems:
- The stream services being utilized still need to be able to gather which songs you are listening to to provide recommendations,
  so requests need to be proxied through the actual streaming service.
- Authentication for every other potential streaming service:
    - YouTube Music:? https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup/oauth.html 
    - Spotify: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization

Little Problems:
- Video and audio need to be kept in sync, accounting for buffering and latency.

Fixed Problems:
- Fucking Jellyfin Authentication (Missing Header)
- Continuous session verification (Fixed with JWTs)
